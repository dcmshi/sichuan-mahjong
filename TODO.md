# TODO

What is actually open. **Everything closed lives in
[docs/history.md](./docs/history.md)**, newest first, each entry with the diagnosis
that made it worth writing down — the phase log, the six audit passes (A1–A40), the
frontend pass (F1–F25), the viewport work (R1–R7), the tile rendering change, the
hosting work (C1–C10), and the feature run N1–N35.

Deferrals are also recorded as O1–O5 in
[ARCHITECTURE.md §12](./ARCHITECTURE.md#12-open-questions--explicit-deferrals).
O5 — per-IP limits keyed to a Cloudflare edge address rather than to the player —
is a **tested, accepted** trade-off rather than an open task; it is listed there
so it isn't rediscovered as a bug.

## Open

**Nothing.** The two tray-geometry items filed on 2026-08-03 — **N36** (the
right-hand seat's pile ran downward and lapped over ink) and **N37** (the across
seat's void declaration sat on the near side of its pile) — both shipped the same
day, along with N19 (a hard bot, and the ladder guard that found medium losing to
easy) and N26 (the nine wind call sites). Each is written up in
[docs/history.md](./docs/history.md).

N23 left one thing open that is not a task: the four Japanese terms it had to
coin, because Sichuan has them and riichi does not — 欠け色, 金鉤釣, 槓上放銃,
花豚 — **want a native speaker's eye**. The borrowed ones do not.

## Shelved, with reasons

- **A central discard pool** (O3) — closed as **won't do**, 2026-08-03. It was
  three wishes in one, and two of them shipped by other means: N33 made every
  seat's full pile one tap away, so the trays' 10-a-side cap costs nothing, and
  `firstDiscardIsVoid` puts each seat's declaration above its own pile. The third
  was the layout motivation — an empty middle — and the well now holds the wall
  diagram, the last discard and the history control. What is left would be a
  fourth route to information already reachable by two, competing for the fullest
  part of the board. Reasoning in
  [ARCHITECTURE.md §12](./ARCHITECTURE.md#12-open-questions--explicit-deferrals).
  Reopen only if the per-seat trays are themselves being reconsidered.

- **A real landscape layout for phones** (R4 Phase 2). Reasons recorded in
  [docs/viewport-audit.md](./docs/viewport-audit.md); landscape shows a
  rotate-to-portrait prompt during play instead.

- **The last three frontend-audit items** (2026-08-02), 17 of 20 having shipped.
  Keyboard hand reordering, modal focus trapping, and spectator parity for
  sound / move history / How-to-play. None is user-facing breakage, which is why
  they are the ones left; each with its reasoning at the top of
  [docs/frontend-audit.md](./docs/frontend-audit.md).
